# Overview

This project explores and visualizes data from the Squirrel Census. Using SQL, the dataset is cleaned, transformed, and analyzed to uncover patterns in squirrel populations. The results are then visualized using Python and Power BI to create meaningful insights.

# Data Source

The dataset is provided by the Squirrel Census team and contains detailed records of squirrel sightings in Central Park, New York. It includes information on:

- Squirrel locations
- Fur colors
- Behaviors
- Interactions with humans

# Project Workflow

- **Data Acquisition:** Download the dataset from the Squirrel Census website.

- **SQL Exploration & Transformation:**

  - Load the dataset into a relational database.

  - Clean and normalize the data.

  - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL queries.

- **Data Visualization:**

  - Use Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for basic visualizations.

  - Create interactive dashboards in Power BI.

  - Insights & Reporting:

  - Document key findings.

  - Generate reports and visualizations.

# Technologies Used

- SQL: PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite (Specify database used)

- Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Power BI: Interactive data visualizations and dashboards

# How to Use

## Prerequisites

  - Install Python and Jupyter Notebook (if using Python for visualization)

  - Install Power BI Desktop (if using Power BI)

  - Set up a database (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite)

  - Setup Instructions

# Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/squirrel-census-sql.git
cd squirrel-census-sql

Load the dataset into your database.

Run SQL queries for data exploration.

Use Python scripts or Power BI files to visualize the results.
